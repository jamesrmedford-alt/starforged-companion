| [Audio Narration](audio-narration-scope.md) | ✅ COMPLETE | ElevenLabs text-to-speech narration overlaid on narrator cards — text remains canonical, audio is enhancement; opt-in per player (client setting) with GM-level voice/model/speed (world setting); inline `<npc>…</npc>` markup splits prose into narrator-vs-NPC segments dispatched to two distinct voices; content-addressed cache at `worlds/${world.id}/audio/${hashPrefix}/${hash}.mp3` (mirroring the sector-art pattern) with GM-gated FilePicker uploads; streaming endpoint where supported with full-generation fallback; click-to-play default with optional auto-play gated by a user-gesture priming overlay; read-only character-budget display via the ElevenLabs subscription endpoint; graceful degradation on key/CORS/rate failures (audio never blocks chat); BYOK `xi-api-key` stored client-scoped in About tab alongside Claude and OpenRouter keys | Narrator, Fact Continuity (sidecar parser), Companion Settings panel | — |
| [Entity → Actor Migration](entity-actor-migration-scope.md) | 📋 PLANNED | Migrate ship → starship and planet/settlement/location → location Actors (with `system.subtype` discriminator); hierarchical Actor folders (Starships / NPCs / PCs / Sectors → per-sector subfolders); collapse settlement-data duplication across four storage layers down to two (Actor = source of truth, slim sector-flag entry for spatial refs); sector-record JournalEntry overview rewritten as UUID document links with debounced `updateActor` re-render; one-time GM-triggered `!migrate-entities` with 7-day deferred cleanup | Ironsworn API, Narrator Entity Discovery, Sector Creator | — |

| [World Journal v1](world-journal-scope.md) | 🔧 SUPERSEDED | Earlier draft of World Journal — replaced by v2 (folder + four category journals, manual `!journal` commands, combined detection-pass routing rule, WJ panel). Kept on disk for design history | — | — |

## What to work on next

- **Visual UI polish** — wire the new `statIcon` / `assetIcon` / `oracleIcon` resolvers into the entity panel and chat cards. Helpers shipped in Phase 9; the templates were not touched in that pass and remain a follow-up.
- **Fact Continuity panel surfaces** — the Entity Panel "Active truths" collapsible and the WJ Panel scene-truth filter row (scope §17 items 26–27) were deferred from the Phase D slice. The correction loop ships without them; they slot naturally into panel-polish work.
- **Fact Continuity ship positioning (§20)** — separate scope section already designed but not yet implemented. Adds a persistent `ship.position` schema, `inferShipPosition` heuristic, three update triggers (`!at`, `set_a_course` non-miss, narrator sidecar `subject: "ship"`), and a sector-scene token-drag trigger.
- **Ability scanner — stat substitution support** — `src/moves/abilityScanner.js` (shipped in the v1.3.1 fixes branch) detects abilities that apply to the chosen move and extracts numeric `+N` adds via regex, but stat-substitution abilities like Empath's *"roll +heart"* surface in the dialog with their text only — the player adjusts the stat manually. Follow-up should extend the scanner / dialog to parse and apply stat substitution automatically (likely as a one-shot LLM extraction returning `{ adds, statReplacement }` per matched ability, plus a stat-override radio in the Confirm dialog).

Other possible directions:

- **Private Channel (📋 planned)** — button-driven floating window for solo player reflection with the narrator; transcript persistence per session; opt-in publish to main chat. See `private-channel-scope.md`. Two Claude Code sessions estimated. Ships independently; audio narration overlays it transparently if both ship.
- **Speech input polish** — push-to-talk reliability, dictation accuracy improvements.
- **Sector Creator iteration** — e.g. richer narrator stubs, additional region templates, post-generation editing.
- **WJ Phase 6 polish** — surface contradiction notifications inside the WJ panel itself (not only the chat card), undo for accidental confirmations.
- **Generative-tier learning** — feed pinned + promoted entries back into the entity-discovery prompt as positive exemplars.
