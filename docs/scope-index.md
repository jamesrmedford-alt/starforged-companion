# Starforged Companion — Scope Index

Single-glance status of all features, and the map from each scope to its
**GitHub issue**. Start here every session to orient quickly.

> **Scope documents now live as GitHub issues, not files.** The per-feature
> `*-scope.md` documents were migrated verbatim into issues #203–#228 and
> removed from `docs/` on 2026-06-24. Each row below links to the issue that
> holds the full scope text and its implementing-commit table. When you start a
> new feature, **open a GitHub issue for its scope** — do not add a
> `*-scope.md` file. See `decisions.md` → "Scope documents live as GitHub
> issues".

Latest release tag: **v1.7.23**.

### Scopes without a dedicated issue

Some shipped work is tracked in `decisions.md` rather than a standalone scope issue:

| Area | Status | Where |
|------|--------|-------|
| Exploration lifecycle (expedition + waypoint) | ✅ COMPLETE | `decisions.md` → "Exploration lifecycle" (v1.7.14) |
| Progress track finishers (combat / vow / expedition / connection chat-card buttons) | ✅ COMPLETE | PRs #201, #202 |

### Supporting infrastructure (no scope issue — see [`file-structure.md`](file-structure.md))

| Area | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Multiplayer coordination | ✅ COMPLETE | `src/multiplayer/gmGate.js` (`isCanonicalGM()`) and `speaker.js` (resolves which PC a chat message belongs to). Meter persistence is GM-gated — see PERSIST-001 in known-issues. |
| Narrator memory ([architecture](narrator/narrator-memory-architecture.md)) | ✅ COMPLETE | Unified narrator-prose feed flags, deterministic sidecar emission, scene frame, lexical relevance + entity cards, rolling session summary. Invariants in `rules/narrator-memory.md`. |
| Playtest Quickstart | ✅ COMPLETE | `src/session/quickstart.js` — one-click fresh-world setup via a hotbar Macro and `module.api.runPlaytestQuickstart()`. |
| Speech input | ✅ COMPLETE | `src/input/speechInput.js` — push-to-talk dictation via the Web Speech API (Chromium). |
| Ship Envision / History | ✅ COMPLETE | `src/entities/shipEnvision.js` — on-demand oracle-driven ship detail beyond the boot-up auto-seed; `!ship envision` / `!ship history`. |

## What to work on next

- **Visual UI polish** — wire the `statIcon` / `assetIcon` / `oracleIcon` resolvers (shipped in System Asset Integration Phase 9) into the entity panel and chat-card templates; the helpers exist but the templates were never updated.
- **Fact Continuity panel surfaces** — the Entity Panel "Active truths" collapsible and the WJ Panel scene-truth filter row were deferred from the Phase D slice; they slot naturally into panel-polish work.
- **Ability scanner — stat substitution** — `src/moves/abilityScanner.js` extracts numeric `+N` adds but surfaces stat-substitution abilities (e.g. Empath's *"roll +heart"*) as text only; extend the scanner/dialog to parse and apply stat substitution automatically.
- **Shipboard Combat Phases B–D** ([#216](https://github.com/jamesrmedford-alt/starforged-companion/issues/216)) — "man the stations" token placement, station-aware move suggestions, and combat-lifecycle integration.

Other possible directions:

- **Speech input polish** — push-to-talk reliability, dictation accuracy.
- **Sector Creator iteration** — richer narrator stubs, additional region templates, post-generation editing.
- **WJ polish** — surface contradiction notifications inside the WJ panel; undo for accidental confirmations.
- **Generative-tier learning** — feed pinned/promoted entries back into the entity-discovery prompt as positive exemplars.
