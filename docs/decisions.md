# Starforged Companion — Architecture Decisions

Key decisions made during development. Read this before making changes to understand
why things are the way they are. Each decision includes the reason and what was
rejected.

---

## Chat command prefix: `!` not `/`

**Decision:** All module commands use `!` prefix (`!x`, `!recap`, `!journal`, `!sector`).

**Reason:** Foundry v13 validates all `/`-prefixed chat messages against `MESSAGE_PATTERNS`
before `createChatMessage` fires. Any unrecognised `/word` matches the invalid pattern
`/^(\/\S+)/` and is rejected with an error — the message is never created and the
module hook never sees it. Native Foundry commands (`/roll`, `/ooc`, `/whisper`, etc.)
still use `/`; module commands must not conflict with this validation.

**What changed:** `registerXCardHook()` checks for `!x`. `isRecapCommand()` checks for
`!recap`. Regexes in `registerChatHook()` updated to `!recap`. `isPlayerNarration()`
excludes messages starting with `!`. All user-facing help text updated.

---

## Testing framework: Vitest (not Jest)

**Decision:** Replace Jest with Vitest.

**Reason:** Jest requires CommonJS-compatible transforms for ESM modules. The module
uses native ES modules throughout (`type: "module"` in package.json). Vitest handles
ESM natively without babel or transform configuration.

**What changed:** `jest.config.js` deleted, `vitest.config.js` added, `tests/setup.js`
rewritten with `global.*` assignments (no Jest globals shim), all test files updated
to import `describe, it, expect, vi` from `vitest` explicitly. `globals: true` in
vitest config makes Jest-style implicit globals available for older test files.

---

## Foundry version: v13 target (not v12)

**Decision:** Write for Foundry v13 with v12 backward compat where trivial.

**What this affects:**

- **ApplicationV2** — all UI panels use `foundry.applications.api.ApplicationV2`.
  v1 Application is deprecated in v13, removed in v16.
- **jQuery removed** — Foundry v13 no longer provides jQuery globally. All DOM
  manipulation uses the standard DOM API (`querySelector`, `createElement`, etc.).
- **`getSceneControlButtons` hook** — in v12, `controls` is an Array. In v13 it is
  an Object keyed by group name. Handler uses `Array.isArray(controls)` check.
- **`ChatMessage.type`** — v13 removed `"other"` as a valid type. Use no type field
  (defaults to `"base"`) or string literals `"ooc"`, `"roll"`, `"whisper"`.
- **`message.author`** — the correct property in both v12 and v13. `message.user`
  was the old name; accessing it in v13 logs a deprecation warning.
- **`CONST.CHAT_MESSAGE_TYPES`** — restructured in v13. All type checks use string
  literals instead.

## CORS proxy: local Node.js proxy + Forge server-side proxy

**Decision:** All external API calls route through `src/api-proxy.js` which detects
the environment and picks the right proxy path.

**Reason:** Foundry's Electron renderer enforces browser CORS. Module JS runs only
in the renderer — not in Node.js. Direct calls to `api.anthropic.com` or
`api.openai.com` are blocked by CORS. Context isolation is enabled (`process`
undefined, `require` undefined), so Electron's Node APIs are not available.

**Desktop path:** Local Node.js proxy at `proxy/claude-proxy.mjs`. Start with
`npm run proxy` or `./proxy/start.sh` before each session. Listens on
`127.0.0.1:3001`. Routes `/v1/*` to Anthropic, `/openai/v1/*` to OpenAI.

**Forge path:** `ForgeAPI.call("proxy", ...)` makes server-side requests from
The Forge's Node.js process. No local proxy needed. Detected via
`typeof ForgeVTT !== "undefined" && ForgeVTT.usingTheForge`.

**Rejected:** Foundry socket relay (player → GM client → API). Unreliable in
single-browser sessions where accounts share a socket connection. Also adds
account-dependency (GM must be connected) which breaks headless/automated use.

---

## Narration: direct Claude API (not Loremaster)

**Decision:** Remove Loremaster dependency. Implement narration directly via Claude.

**Reason:** Loremaster only responds to messages sent by the GM account. Player
clients cannot trigger narration without a socket relay, which is unreliable in
single-browser sessions and adds account-dependency for multiplayer. Additionally:
no control over narrative style, voice, or prompt; Loremaster uses v1 Application
framework (deprecated in v13); dependency on Patreon-gated external service.

**What replaced it:** `src/narration/narrator.js` + `src/narration/narratorPrompt.js`.
Direct Claude API call via `api-proxy.js`. Configurable model (Haiku/Sonnet),
perspective, tone, length, and custom instructions per campaign. Narration runs
on whichever client triggered the move — no GM dependency.

**Files removed:** `src/loremaster.js`. Loremaster settings removed from
`settingsPanel.js`. Socket relay removed from `index.js`.

---

## Mischief dial naming: `normalizeDial()` bridge

**Decision:** `settingsPanel.js` stores `"lawful"/"balanced"/"chaotic"`.
`mischief.js` uses `"serious"/"balanced"/"chaotic"` internally. `normalizeDial()`
maps `"lawful"` → `"serious"` at all three consumption points.

**Reason:** The two files were written independently with different assumptions about
the dial value names. Rather than changing one file's naming convention (which would
require touching all tests and UI labels), a bridge function was added.

**Where it lives:** Top of `src/moves/mischief.js`. Called at the start of
`buildMischiefFraming()`, `shouldApplyMischief()`, and `buildMischiefAside()`.

---

## Safety config storage: sync bridge

**Decision:** `settingsPanel.js` writes Lines/Veils to `game.settings`. The assembler
reads from `campaignState.safety`. `syncSafetyToCampaignState()` bridges them.

**Reason:** The two systems were written independently. `game.settings` is the natural
storage for UI-managed configuration. `campaignState` is the natural source of truth
for the context assembler. Rather than refactor one to use the other's storage,
a sync function runs on every write and on the `ready` hook.

**Private Lines:** Stored client-scoped in `game.settings`. In `campaignState.safety.
privateLines`, they are stored as `[{ playerId, lines }]` objects so each player's
Lines are preserved when any one player's client syncs.

---

## Progress tracks: single dedicated journal

**Decision:** All progress tracks stored in ONE JournalEntry named "Starforged
Progress Tracks", as a flag directly on the JournalEntry (not on a page).

**Confirmed storage (from live testing and progressTracks.js source):**
```js
// Write
await journal.setFlag("starforged-companion", "tracks", tracksArray);

// Read
const tracks = journal.getFlag("starforged-companion", "tracks") ?? [];
```

**Not:** `journal.pages.contents[0].getFlag(...)` — the journal has no pages.
This distinction matters: JournalEntry flags and JournalEntryPage flags are
completely separate. The tracks journal creates no pages.

**Reason:** Initially designed with per-track journal entries. Changed because
individual journal entries created UI clutter and made bulk operations require
scanning the entire journal collection. Single journal with a flag array is
simpler and faster.

**Impact:** `assembler.js` `buildProgressTracksSection()` must call
`journal.getFlag(MODULE_ID, "tracks")` directly — NOT read from a page.
`campaignState.progressTrackIds` is unused for this purpose.

---

## Portrait generation: generate once, one regeneration, then locked

**Decision:** Portraits follow a three-state lifecycle: none → unlocked → locked.
One regeneration is permitted. After that the portrait is permanently locked.

**Reason:** Art generation is expensive and the campaign wants visual consistency.
Locking after regeneration prevents iterating endlessly on a portrait and ensures
entities have a stable visual identity across sessions.

**State stored on:** `ArtAsset.regenerationUsed` (boolean) and `ArtAsset.locked`
(boolean). The superseded asset gets `ArtAsset.superseded = true` and is retained
for the session log.

---

## `foundry-shim.js`: deleted

**Decision:** `src/foundry-shim.js` was deleted. Entity files had their import
statements removed via `scripts/remove-shim-imports.js`.

**Reason:** The shim was created to make Foundry globals available in Jest tests.
Switching to Vitest with `tests/setup.js` providing stubs via `global.*` assignments
made the shim unnecessary. The shim also caused 404 errors in the Foundry renderer
when module files tried to import it at runtime.

---

## CI release: update `module.json` before building zip

**Decision:** The CI release job updates `module.json` (version, download URL,
manifest URL) BEFORE building the zip.

**Reason:** The zip was originally built first, then `module.json` was updated as a
separate step. This meant the zip contained an old `module.json` with empty download
and manifest URLs. Foundry reads the manifest from inside the installed zip to check
for updates — an empty manifest URL means Foundry can never find an update. Swapping
the order fixed both the update detection and the version display.

---

## Claude API model selection

**Interpretation (move identification):** `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` — fast, cheap,
structured JSON output. System prompt cached with `cache_control: ephemeral`.
Prompt caching makes interpretation nearly free per call.

**Narration:** `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` default, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`
available. Sonnet produces noticeably richer prose. System prompt cached. Cost per
session at Sonnet: ~$0.05. Configurable per campaign in module settings.

**Why not Opus:** Overkill for both tasks. Haiku handles structured output well.
Sonnet handles atmospheric prose well. Opus is for complex reasoning tasks neither
of these require.

---

## Narrator tone and perspective

**Tone: wry** — knowing and slightly sardonic, aware of consequence without
wallowing in it. The narrator has seen this before. It notices the irony. It
does not editorialize, but it does not pretend not to notice. This is the
default and the recommended setting for Ironsworn: Starforged, which has an
existing tradition of spare, consequential prose with occasional dark wit.

**Perspective: auto** — second person ("you") for solo campaigns, third person
(character names) for multiplayer. Resolved at narration time from the count of
active non-GM users. Can be overridden to a fixed value per campaign.

**Why auto rather than a fixed default:** Second person creates intimacy in solo
play — the narrator is addressing the player directly, which suits the journaling
nature of Ironsworn solo. Third person is more natural for multiplayer where
multiple characters are present and "you" becomes ambiguous.

**Both are configurable** in the Narrator tab of module settings. The auto
logic lives in `resolveNarrationPerspective()` in `src/narration/narrator.js`.
